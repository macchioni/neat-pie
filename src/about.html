<p>Hi again, this is Piero.
<ul>
<li>I'm the deputy editor-in-chief at Grazia and Grazia Food.</li>
<li>I run an indie food newsletter called Secret Breakfast, you should subscribe and have fun.</li>
<li>I wrote a book about food trends interviewing 23 food personalities. You get it here, it's free.</li>
<li>I wrote an essay about Artificial Intelligence and the art of baking bread, before ChatGPT was a thing.</li>
<li>My old blog, leibniz*, was a tribute to the brilliant, albeit somewhat unconventional, philosopher.</li>
<li>At 17, I wrote a scathing review of one of Italy's greatest writers in a national newspaper.</li>
<li>I know suffering and pain, yet I believe something incredible can always happen: I'm an AS Roma fan.</li>
</ul>

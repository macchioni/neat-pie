<h4>Hi, this is Piero Macchioni</h4>

          <p>⚙︎ I'm the deputy editor-in-chief at <a href="https://grazia.it">Grazia</a> and <a href="https://www.grazia.it/graziafood">Grazia Food</a>.</p>

          <p>✉︎ I run an indie food newsletter called <a href="https://secretbreakfast.com">Secret Breakfast</a>, you should subscribe and have fun.</p>

          <p>✍︎ I wrote a book about food trends interviewing 23 food personalities. You get it <a href="https://secretbreakfast.gumroad.com/l/2023-book">here</a>, it's free.</p>

          <p>☕︎ I wrote an essay about <a href="https://www.lintegralerivista.it/titoli/contronatura/">Artificial Intelligence and the art of baking bread</a>, before ChatGPT was a thing.</p>

          <p>∗ My old blog, <a href="https://leibniz.me">leibniz*</a>, was a tribute to the brilliant, albeit somewhat unconventional, philosopher.</p>

          <p>⇝ At 17, I wrote a <a href="/blog/posts/2020-03-23-alberto-arbasino-mekong/">scathing review</a> of one of Italy's greatest writers in a national newspaper.</p>

          <p>⚽︎ I know suffering and pain, yet I believe something incredible can always happen: I'm an AS Roma fan.</p>
